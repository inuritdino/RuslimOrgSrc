"A confession" is one of the greatest works by Leo Tolstoy (while the
most popular "War and peace" or "Anna Karenina" do not belong to the
rank according to the author himself). This work requires self
re-evaluation and criticism in the face of the well justified
evidence. It is a profound study made meticulously logical as if it
were written by a mathematician or a scientist. However, the topic
differs much from the usual pursuit of science: the reality of death
and (inevitable) conclusions derived from it.

Besides other obvious benefits of the reading, the work is a logical
continuation to [our first affirmation](/essay/death.html) of death,
from which we have not arrived at any conclusions... just yet. The
essay tries in a beautifully rigorous intellectual attempt to outline
the *meaning* of the reality of death.

Tolstoy made an elaborate study of the topic through the prism of many
other works of prominent philosophers and thinkers and weaved it into
the perceptions of his own life. Thus, it is a good objective summary,
although it might look like a biographical essay.
