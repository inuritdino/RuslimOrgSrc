<p style="text-align: center;">
Come let us mock at the great<br/>
That had such burdens on the mind<br/>
And toiled so hard and late<br/>
To leave some monument behind,<br/>
Nor thought of the levelling wind.<br/>
<br/>
Come let us mock at the wise;<br/>
With all those calendars whereon<br/>
They fixed old aching eyes,<br/>
They never saw how seasons run,<br/>
And now but gape at the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Come let us mock at the good<br/>
That fancied goodness might be gay,<br/>
And sick of solitude<br/>
Might proclaim a holiday:<br/>
Wind shriekedâ€”and where are they?<br/>
<br/>
Mock mockers after that<br/>
That would not lift a hand maybe<br/>
To help good, wise or great<br/>
To bar that foul storm out, for we<br/>
Traffic in mockery.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">W.B. Yeats</p>
