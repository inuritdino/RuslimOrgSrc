Ruslim.org is a group of **experts** with strong **will** to acquire
new knowledge.

#### Why Do We Need Experts?

Experts tend to speak truly and impartially about their fields of
expertise, which helps to overcome the simplest type of
ignorance. Furthermore, the real experts are less emotionally
affected, due to the constant interaction with their profession and
more objective view of it.

#### Why Do We Need Willing Experts?

However, the specialised masters usually overestimate capacity of
their fields in finding solutions of any kind. In other words, they
have *over-confidence* in their knowledge and they are *tempted* to
apply it outside their domain of expertise. This constitutes the
*expert problem*. Hence, we need experts willing to grow.

"*One has no right to love or hate anything if one has not acquired a
thorough knowledge of its nature. Great love springs from great
knowledge of the beloved object, and if you know it but little you
will be able to love it only a little or not at all*" (as attributed
to Leonardo Da Vinci).
