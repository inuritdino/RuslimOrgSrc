Two elements are essential in getting to truth:

- Practice what you believe about the world.
- Always adopt and follow what you find truthful.

The first rule will help you *to discover* errors.

The second one will help you *to get rid of* errors.

If you honestly measure up things and events to the paradigm that you
have about the world, you discover situations where the paradigm does
not work. This process is a continuous empirical verification of life
against a model that you have built in the head.

Once the errors of the model are discovered, you have to try to adjust
or rewrite the model, so that you can remove the erroneous concepts
from the governing paradigm. Thus, you can get closer to truth, or
learn.
