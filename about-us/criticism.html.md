On Ruslim.Org we adopt a principle for criticism:

> **Criticize only that which you know/love**

By "**know**" we mean one is an expert in the field he/she is going to
criticize. Furthermore, one is supposed to be in "**love**" with the
field of criticism.

We do not expect a math teacher to (seriously) comment on biology. We
do not accept criticism on a math theorem from an artist fairly
accustomed to math practices.

Note, however, this rule has some exceptions. Noteworthy, a theologian
taught philosophers what philosophy is without being a philosopher (in
the meantime being accused of practicing philosophy amongst brother
theologians). This theologian has all the rights to criticize
philosophy.

Also, some "fields" do not need experts: one does not need biology to
know what life is, although the former calls its objects "living
things". One does not need Bernoulli theorem to claim that 2+2 is not
5.

So, this rule must not be taken to extremes.

Example 1: do you expect your child to learn math from BBC news? Yet,
some people take their knowledge of religion, politics, and other
sociologically relevant fields from that kind of sources...

Example 2: some renowned math professor decides to make his
contribution to history. He writes a book where everything so nicely
and logically connected to each other, each claim smoothly relates to
the previously made propositions, but ... he hastily mentions, all to
support his derivations, that the kingdom of Alexander the Great has
fallen under the raids of Mongols...

Example 3: A Nobel prize laureate in physics writes a book on meaning
of life, where he defines life as water (indeed, all life is based on
water). All science is easily derived afterwards. Similarly, a Nobel
prize laureate in medicine gives a lecture on life, but his definition
of life is somewhat different from what everybody understands as
such. And he continues talking about cells...
