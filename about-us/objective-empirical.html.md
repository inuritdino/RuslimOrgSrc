On these pages *empirical* is used in strong connection to *practical*
and *objective*, **not** in connection to empiricism and ultimately to
the philosophy of nominalism. Empirically verified facts are closer to
truth and objectivity, that is why we consider the empirical method to
be powerful. In fact, there is nothing that can prevent the method to
refute nominalism itself in favor of, for example, realism.

Truly, as one cannot define the *essence* of a thing, there is no way
to objectively verify its existence <a href="#f1">[1]</a>. Moreover,
if someone discriminates one method over the other (e.g. inductive
vs. deductive) based merely on a speculation, how can we trust such a
philosophy? A simple thought experiment has proven to be misleading in
many cases --- the world's reality is much "**smarter**" than we
imagine in our heads. The speculative thought, like that of
nominalism, is useful when one can design an experiment in trying to
refute it (Karl Popper). But when this thought is more related to the
minds of its initiators and followers and not to the reality, the
empirical objective testing of its validity seems to be impossible to
accomplish.

Hence, nominalism (and, perhaps, much of philosophy) is a rationally
justified belief. However, we are trying to find the method for
objective verification, that is verification that can be done by
potentially anybody (**testable** evidence). This is what the
empirical method is for us <a href="#f2">[2]</a>.

Note also, that we understand the method wider than in traditional
epistemology (e.g. logic): for example, obvious truths (like "whole is
greater than its parts") are also *empirical* here, because one can go
outside and apply the obvious rules to any object to see if they hold.

Finally, *practical* does not refer to the practicality of the
philosophical pragmatism. We are not trying to resolve argues to the
practical benefit only, that is to attain *local* or *subjective* or
*ad hoc* truth. We are trying to reach *objective* truth, which, we
believe, will be the **most** beneficial for all.

<a name="f1" />[1] I do not know about any empirical result showing
reliably existence/nonexistence of essences. At the moment, they are
from the realm of belief. Let me know if I am wrong.

<a name="f2" />[2] Our proposal is much stricter in regards to
empirically obtained knowledge, so that it rules out many "scientific"
areas, which are full of speculative thought and respective
adherents. And we will see later on these pages, that it rules out
many empirical experimentations themselves as these do not pass the
repeatability tests, in other words, the results are not reproducible.
