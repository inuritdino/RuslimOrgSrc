Ruslim.Org is built using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a
static site generator. After a while, and some struggle with
complicated database based systems and with no less sophisticated
hosting providers, we have decided that Ruslim.Org is all about
reading, hence, no standing on the head is needed, plain text would
suffice. After all, it is easier to maintain, to store, to migrate, to
change, upload and faster for our users.

The pages found here can be downloaded ("cloned") from
[a GitHub account](https://github.com/inuritdino/RuslimOrg) and
correspondingly found as
[GitHub Pages](https://inuritdino.github.io/RuslimOrg/). We also
accept a standard "programmer" way to propose
changes/corrections/proposals to our material using the GitHub "Pull
Request" system.

Our pages should be well formatted for all devices, from smartphones
to desktops. We also support Mobile First strategy. Every page has a
print option, printed version of a page is all black-and-white (except
for images). Additionally, every page (in desktop or landscape view)
has expand option (little &raquo; sign in the top right corner), which
expands the content to full width removing the sidebar menu.

Font is Book Antiqua, a good option for book-like reading. We had long
nights choosing the font size and line spacing for better reading
experience.
