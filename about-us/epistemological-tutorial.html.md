*What* we know and *How* we know (it) are the starting points of the
classical branch of philosophy, so called *epistemology*. We take
epistemology a bit further into the practical domain, which is
twofold:

* we are interested in *practical consequences* of the epistemological
  conclusions (no studies on "the redness of red", "reality of the
  reality", "utility of the third eye").
* we consider knowledge problems *quantitatively* as opposed to just
  qualitative studies so usual in speculation-prone areas.

We look for *objectivity* in everything (not claiming it necessarily
exists!). Hence, we emphasize
[*empirical*](/about-us/objective-empirical.html) and *testable*
evidence (not claiming it can always help you out!). So, this project
is an *experiment*: We would like to find out *quantitatively* the
limits of objectivity in everything, especially, in our abilities to
comprehend.

**Note for philosophy haters**: we are not philosophers, nor do we
tend to become ones. We are forced to set off for *sincere search* by
the *real* problems. Anywhere in this resource you can substitute
<del>philosophy</del>/<del>epistemology</del> with **knowledge**/
**understanding**/ **search**. We nurture *intellectual honesty*, that
is, when you <u>know</u> something you *must* act upon it. But how do
you know that you know and how much do you know? Exactly the practical
life issues oblige us to turn to philosophical, empirical, and other
methodologies...

Therefore, we are trying to address epistemological problems: i) by
consistent processing of the materials pertaining thereto and ii) in
tutorial-like fashion to achieve maximum practical outcome (thus,
adding a new perspective to epistemology: *how do we make use* of what
we know given how we know it). Practically, we look for changes
required by the new *reliable* knowledge.

Alternatively, if you mirror the problem, you could call an
epistemological guide "a guide to ignorance", that is a tour to "how
much you *do not* know". So, Ruslim.Org is "Your Guide to Ignorance"
as well as "A Guide to *Your* Ignorance".

(Strictly speaking, the *practical* aspect of the Greek *episteme*,
-->epistemology, is its sister *techne*, -->technology. Thus,
"practical epistemology" translates to "technology", which does not
make much sense in the modern context. Alternatively, we could call
this endeavor "technology of knowing".)

(**Note for Ancient Greece haters**: we do not fall in love with Greek
philosophy, nor with any philosophy for that matter, but we mainly
address the Western society, which, they believe, rests on the Ancient
Greece legacy. Other cultures certainly do have better words for
various kinds of "knowledge" allowing for more sophisticated
descriptions.)

Finally, we do not claim to cover everything, we are just a piece in
an ocean of the real problems and, most importantly, their
epistemological resolutions. The broader coverage of the problems
require an active on-line community to be part of the process. And we
virtually embrace all new members!

DISCLAIMER: there are people not willing to understand and change no
matter what evidence is presented to them. Such people are largely
ignored here. We collaborate only with those searching with open eyes
in the world so easily giving ideological nurture to the blind.
